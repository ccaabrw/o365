Use Get-ConnectionInformation to determine if connected and operable
Call Connect-ExchangeOnline if not
Are there parameters to specify the account to connet as?
Can we use a certificate for auth instead?

What version of module is required?

As of May 2023 - just installed this one:
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -RequiredVersion 3.1.0

Does this supercede old versions?
